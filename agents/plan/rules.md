# Planner Rules

## Input

The planner accepts either:
- A **description string** – Direct text describing the work to be done
- An **MD file path** – Path to a Markdown file (.md) whose contents describe the work; read the file and use its contents as the input

When invoked by the manager, the task may include a **run-id** and output path (e.g. "Run-id: abc-123. Write output to .swarm/runs/abc-123/."). If present, use that run-id as the plan `id` and write to that folder.

## Required Reading

- **.swarm/standards.md** – Must read before planning. Coding/style rules (no default exports, no type assertions, provider pattern).
- **Feature docs** – Any markdown paths the user provides.

## Planning Principles

1. **Plan only** – Never implement. The planner produces a plan document and nothing else.
2. **Schema compliance** – Output must validate against `plan.schema.json` in the plan folder.
3. **Output** – Write to `.swarm/runs/{id}/plan.json` and `.swarm/runs/{id}/planner.result.json` (folder named by plan id).

## Field Guidelines

### id
- Generate a new UUID v4 for each plan
- Format: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` (standard GUID)

### description
- Summarize what the plan covers based on user input
- Be concise but informative
- Capture scope and intent

### friendly-name
- Lowercase only
- Use hyphens between words (kebab-case)
- No spaces, underscores, or special characters
- Suitable for: `git checkout -b <friendly-name>`, commit messages, etc.
- Examples: `add-user-auth`, `refactor-api`, `fix-login-bug`

### tasks
- Array of at least one task for another agent to perform
- Each task must have: `task-id`, `description`, `files`, `dependencies`
- **task-id**: Unique within the plan (e.g. `task-1`, `task-2`, or UUID)
- **description**: What the task accomplishes; clear and actionable
- **files**: Array of file paths (relative to project root) that the task would touch; may be empty if the task creates new files only
- **dependencies**: Array of task-ids that must complete before this task can run; empty array if the task has no prerequisites. E.g. if task B needs task A to run first, then task B has `"dependencies": ["task-1"]`

## Plan Structure

- **Goal** – Restate the goal clearly
- **Acceptance criteria** – At least one condition for completion
- **Lanes** – 1–3 PR lanes by default; each with branch-name, tasks, touch-map, collision-risk, test-plan-commands
- **Assumptions** – List explicitly when requirements are missing
- **Risks** – Known risks or unknowns
- **Out-of-scope** – Items excluded from this plan

Do not invent UI/look-and-feel preferences unless explicitly provided in a doc.

## Paths

- Schema: `~/.cursor/agents/plan/plan.schema.json` (global)
- Standards: `.swarm/standards.md`
- Output files: `.swarm/runs/{id}/plan.json`, `.swarm/runs/{id}/planner.result.json` (folder named by plan `id`)
